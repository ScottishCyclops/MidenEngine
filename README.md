Old version of my work in progress engine.

I keep it for reference, might disapear soon.

Original README :


# Miden Engine
3D Software renderer built on top of SDL2 from scratch in C++.

This is a personnal project aimed at improuving my C++ skills and understanding of game engines.

I first started this project using Python.

I went pretty far, but decided to start over in C++ for obvious performance gains.

## Features
- Double buffering
- Triangle rasterization
- Texture mapping
- backface culling
- .obj mesh import
- .bmp texture import

Note : obj import requiers certain options, it is not designed to handle any obj exported file

## Goals
- do calculations on GPU
- create a little 3D game with the engine (maybe)

## Built from Qt with SDL.
Qt : https://www.qt.io/

SDL : https://libsdl.org/
