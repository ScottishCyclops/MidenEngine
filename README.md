# MidenEngine
3D Engine built on top of Xlib from scratch in C++.

This is a personnal project aimed at improuving my C++ skills and understanding of game engines.

I first started this project using Python.
I went pretty far, but decided to start over in C++ for obvious performance gains.

Features
- Double buffering
- ...

Goals
- move away from any existing libraries.
- create a 3D engine usable to create a video game
- enable GPU calculation
